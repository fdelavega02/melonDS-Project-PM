// Project PM online relay (PMRELAY1) control surface.
//
// The relay transport itself lives with the rest of the fork bridge in
// EmuThread.cpp; this is the small thread-safe surface the Qt UI uses to start
// an online session and to display its state.  Nothing here pulls in winsock,
// so Qt sources can include it freely: the resolved relay address travels as
// opaque bytes.
//
// Threading: MpOnlineResolve() blocks (DNS) and must be called from the UI
// thread at click time, never from the emulation thread's frame loop.  The
// start/stop calls only post a request; the emulation thread picks it up on
// its next bridge pump.
